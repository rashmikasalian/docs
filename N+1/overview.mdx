## What is the N+1 Engine?

The **N+1 Engine** is Mantrika.ai’s internal talent mobility and elevation agent — designed to unlock the full potential of your existing workforce by identifying, preparing, and promoting employees into future roles.

> **N+1** = Next-level role readiness  
> The N+1 Engine answers: *Who in our system is ready to move up — and how do we get them there?*
