title: Talent Mapping & Readiness
---

The N+1 Engine begins with a core objective: **understand who your people are today, and who they can become tomorrow.** This is achieved through continuous **talent mapping and readiness scoring** using Mantrika.ai’s decision science frameworks.

It enables organizations to shift from static org charts to **living talent maps**, where every employee has a visible, evolving trajectory.

## Digital Talent Twin (Internal)

Every employee is modeled as a **Digital Talent Twin (DT²)** — an evolving, AI-powered profile that combines:

| Data Layer | Includes |
|------------|----------|
| Skill Signals | Resume, certifications, project contributions, manager feedback |
| Behavioral Signals | Learning engagement, initiative, communication tone |
| Performance Signals | Appraisal history, OKRs, role-based milestones |
| Career Aspirations | Inputs from career conversations, internal job interests |
| Org Context | Team, manager, BU, location, current level/title |

The twin updates continuously from HRIS, LMS, ATS, feedback tools, and even employee inputs.

## SWTT Fit Mapping

Just like in external hiring, the N+1 Engine applies a tailored **SWTT** framework for internal career planning:

| SWTT Axis | Measures |
|-----------|----------|
| **Skill** | Current capability vs target role requirements |
| **Will** | Motivation, curiosity, initiative toward growth |
| **Task** | Role context match, complexity handling ability |
| **Time** | Bandwidth, availability, and timing to move roles |

### Output:
- **Role Readiness Score**
- **Gap-to-Ready Radar Chart**
- **Best Bet / Stretch Fit / Ready Now** labels

This enables both employees and talent owners to understand *what’s possible* and *what’s needed next*.

## Talent Mapping Dashboards

Jobsphere populates **interactive org-wide views** of talent potential:

| View | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| Readiness Grid | Employees mapped by current vs target level readiness |
| Mobility Heatmap | Which BUs or geographies are high in ready talent |
| SWTT Drift Map | Employees whose SWTT scores indicate mismatch or disengagement |
| Persona Pools | Employees grouped by ambition, skill level, growth path (e.g., Builders, Explorers, Stabilizers) |

Managers and HRBPs can filter these views by:
- Function
- Level
- Gender
- Tenure
- Manager

## Talent Risk & Opportunity Signals

The N+1 Engine doesn’t just map — it **alerts**.

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|----------------|
| Mobility Blockage | Employee is ready but has had no internal movement |
| Readiness Expiry | Learning completed, role matched — but action delayed |
| Manager Blind Spot | High-potential employee not surfaced in career plans |
| Talent Hoarding | Employee repeatedly skipped for openings in other BUs |
| Hidden Fit | Employee ready for adjacent role they haven’t explored yet |

---

## Applications of Talent Mapping

| Use Case | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Succession Planning | Real-time depth view of role successors |
| Internal Hiring | Priority candidates surfaced before opening goes external |
| L&D Alignment | Skill gaps auto-aligned with learning pathways |
| Engagement Programs | High-readiness talent enrolled into growth cohorts |
| Strategic Workforce Planning | BU-level visibility into mobility potential |

---

## Summary

Talent Mapping in the N+1 Engine transforms raw employee data into a **living, intelligent talent landscape** — constantly evolving with behavior, business needs, and ambition.

> Stop guessing who’s ready.  
> The N+1 Engine **knows who’s next.**
