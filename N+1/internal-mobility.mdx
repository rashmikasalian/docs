title: Internal Mobility & Succession
---

The N+1 Engine doesn’t just score readiness — it acts on it.  
This phase focuses on **activating internal mobility** and ensuring that **succession planning** is no longer guesswork, but data-driven, inclusive, and proactive.

By enabling visibility, eliminating friction, and surfacing talent in real-time, this stage transforms career growth from a “push” to a “pull” — giving employees **agency** and managers **clarity**.

## Internal Opportunity Marketplace

### What It Is:
A dynamic, bias-aware internal job board and recommendation system powered by the Digital Talent Twin and Career Fit Engine.

### Features:
- Personalized job suggestions based on SWTT readiness
- Nudges to apply based on learning or project completion
- Role alerts tied to career aspiration signals
- Visibility into cross-BU, global, or hybrid roles

### Benefits:
- Increases internal hiring rates
- Empowers employees to grow without waiting
- Reduces external hiring costs

## Career Mobility Nudges

The N+1 Engine sends **intelligent nudges** to keep employees and managers action-ready.

| Nudge Type | Sent To | Trigger |
|------------|---------|---------|
| “You're 85% ready for this new role” | Employee | Readiness score > threshold |
| “You have internal applicants for this opening” | Manager | New role posted |
| “Time to check in on your top talent” | HRBP | Engagement or readiness dip |
| “Talent Hoarding Detected” | Manager/HR | Repeated blockages in mobility |

## Succession Planning System

Succession planning in the N+1 Engine is proactive and continuous — not a one-time spreadsheet.

### Core Components:
- Bench strength matrix by level, BU, and geography
- Successor match prediction (fit + readiness)
- Risk index for leadership gaps or vacancy exposure
- Talent development triggers for ready-but-not-visible employees

### Output Views:
- 9-box succession grid (potential vs performance)
- Readiness forecast for critical roles
- Leadership depth per department or region

---

## Leadership Acceleration Pathways

Employees tagged as **high-potential or ready-soon** are:
- Enrolled into mentorship programs
- Mapped to rotational or stretch projects
- Tracked for leadership behavior signals
- Auto-aligned with learning journeys (via Luma)

This builds a **sustainable leadership pipeline** from within — reducing dependency on expensive external executive searches.

## Fairness & Visibility by Design

The Internal Mobility & Succession engine includes built-in checks for:

| Checkpoint | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| DEI Bias Guard | Prevents gender, background, or tenure-based bias in career match |
| Visibility Index | Highlights employees lacking mobility visibility |
| Talent Marketplace Analytics | Tracks % of internal vs external fills per role type |
| Explainability Layer | Shows why an employee is a match (SWTT factors, learning, manager feedback) |

---

## Metrics Tracked

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Internal Mobility Ratio | % of roles filled by internal talent |
| Role Readiness Conversion | % of ready talent that moved within 6 months |
| Succession Coverage Score | % of key roles with 2+ successors |
| Nudge-to-Action Rate | % of nudges that led to job views, applications, or approvals |
| Manager Mobility Support Score | Manager openness to internal movements (tracked by feedback + action) |
