## Structured 30-60-90 Day Ramp-Up Plans

Each new hire is auto-enrolled into a **custom onboarding blueprint** tied to:
- Business Unit
- Role persona
- Previous engagement pattern

Includes:
- Goal tracking
- Check-ins with managers and buddies
- Feedback surveys at milestone points

Output: **Ramp Velocity Index** – measures how quickly each hire reaches productivity milestones.

## Loop Closure & College Feedback

N-1 Engine closes the loop with:
- **Candidates**: Feedback on the experience, gaps, and retention indicators
- **Colleges**: Reports on performance, skill readiness, dropout analysis, and fit metrics

This feedback is stored for **future batch planning**, so your strategy evolves with each cycle.

---

## Talent Pool Reuse & Referral Signals

Candidates who:
- Dropped off after offer
- Performed well but weren’t hired
- Completed internships successfully

…are tagged and segmented into **future-fit pools**, ready to be reactivated in:
- Off-cycle intakes
- Lateral early-career roles
- Referral engines for future batches
