## 📡 Signal Sources Powering Insights

Recruit Edge pulls from multiple data layers:

- 🗂️ Structured: ATS logs, HRIS records, performance data  
- 📄 Semi-Structured: Resumes, JD parsing, interview notes  
- 🗣️ Unstructured: Candidate emails, chatbot transcripts, survey feedback  
- 🔁 Behavioral: Clickstreams, nudges, interview prompt response time  
- 🔐 Verification: BGV outcomes, identity validation  
- 📈 Post-Hire: Ramp-up progress, feedback loops, attrition risks

These diverse inputs feed into **Digital Talent Twins** and continuously refine the platform’s decision models.

---

## 📥 Closed-Loop Feedback

Every signal — success or failure — feeds back into the system:

- If a hire underperforms → Fit model gets refined
- If a candidate drops off → Offer scoring logic adjusts
- If DEI targets aren’t met → Outreach or JD language adapts
- If onboarding success is high → Blueprint gets replicated

> This is what makes Recruit Edge truly *agentic* — it **learns from outcomes** and improves without manual intervention.

---

## 📈 Example Insight Cards

### 📌 Fit Signal Spike:
> “Candidate X shows a 40% higher fit probability than others interviewed for this role. Consider fast-tracking.”

### 📌 Offer Risk Alert:
> “Candidate Y has a 25% acceptance risk. Consider alternate comp mix or faster follow-up.”

### 📌 Location Intelligence Nudge:
> “Tier 2 cities show higher availability of UI/UX talent with lower attrition and higher DEI potential.”

### 📌 Belonging Red Flag:
> “New hire Z has not logged into onboarding portal or AI Buddy in 4 days. Recommend early engagement.”

## 🧠 Predict → Act → Learn → Optimize

Recruit Edge uses a **continuous optimization loop**:

1. **Predict**: Fit, risk, offer outcomes, ramp success  
2. **Act**: Recommend nudges, decisions, alternatives  
3. **Learn**: From real-world outcomes and candidate feedback  
4. **Optimize**: Models retrain, weightings adjust, next outcomes improve

This self-learning loop makes Recruit Edge **not just accurate today, but smarter tomorrow**.
