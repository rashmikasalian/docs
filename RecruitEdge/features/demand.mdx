title: Demand Generation
---

## 🎯 Purpose
The Demand Generation module kickstarts the Recruit Edge recruitment supply chain by helping recruiters create structured, market-aligned job demands.
Leveraging AI-driven Location Favorability Index (LFI) and Demand-Market Fit Index (DMFI), it provides actionable insights on where to source talent and how to competitively position roles—right at the start of the hiring process.

## 🗺️ Scope 
To deliver high-impact recommendations, Demand Generation ingests and processes a broad range of data, including:
- Internal Hiring Metrics: Offer-to-join rates, time-to-fill, and SWTT success patterns.
- Location Signals: Talent supply, attrition, and cost-of-hire from labor-market APIs.
- Competitive Data: Live job-board activity, salary benchmarks, and employer-brand sentiment.
- AI Outputs: LFI and DMFI composite scores for geography favorability and market competitiveness.

| **Location Intelligence (LFI)**     | Identifies optimal sourcing zones using AI-powered insights on talent availability, cost, and closure success.    |
| **Competitive Intelligence (DMFI)** | Benchmarks role attractiveness based on salary data, skill scarcity, and competitor hiring velocity.              |
| **SWTT Mapping**                    | Structures job demands into Skill, Will, Task, and Time dimensions to power AI matching and downstream workflows. |
| **AI-Driven Market Analytics**      | Integrates labor trends, supply–demand dynamics, and closure history to guide role design decisions.              |
| **Demand Structuring**              | Packages job inputs into a structured format for sourcing, screening, interview planning, and analysis.           |

## ⚙️ How It Works 
#### **Step 1: Requirement Gathering**
>
Recruiters initiate demand creation by providing foundational job inputs that feed into downstream intelligence layers.  
- Job title, department, experience range, number of Openings
- Hiring urgency and replacement context
- Must-have skills and any preferred locations
>
**_Optional Early Branch:_ Location Confirmation**  
Prompt: “Have you finalized your target hiring location(s)?”  
If Yes → Proceed directly to Location Favorability Index (LFI)  
If No → System:
- Suggests intelligent defaults based on past hires and role patterns
- Enables searchable, ranked global location input powered by LFI

#### **Step 2: Location Favorability Index (LFI)**
>
| Factor                | What It Evaluates                                                            | 
| ----------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Talent Density        | Number of candidates matching the SWTT profile in each location        | 
| Offer Success Rate    | Past offer-to-join conversion for similar roles                        | 
| Cost Index            | Composite of average salary + operational overhead                     | 
| Attrition Probability | Historical turnover rates for the region or role                       |
| Closure Velocity      | Time-to-fill for similar roles in prior cycles                         |

**Visual Output:**
- Heatmaps of best-fit locations
- Ranked sourcing zones with LFI scores
- Labeling: “High-fit”, “Low-velocity”, “High-cost” 

🔄 _If live market data is unavailable, LFI is inferred from similar historical roles with matching SWTT profiles._

#### **Step 3: Dynamic Market Fit Index (DMFI)**
>
| Factor                | What It Evaluates                                                            | 
| ----------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Compensation Fit      | How the offered salary compares to the current market benchmark        | 
| Skill Demand/Supply   | Ratio of market demand to talent supply for the required skills        | 
| Competitor Activity   | Number of open jobs in similar companies for this role                 | 
| Role Scarcity         | Uniqueness or niche-level of the skill set (risk of low volume)        |

**Visual Output:**
- Role attractiveness card with DMFI score
- Recommendations: “Adjust salary,” “Widen skills,” or “Consider alternate locations”
- Graphical comparison of internal vs. market compensation

#### **Step 4: SWTT Mapping**  
>
After finalizing location and compensation intelligence, the job role is decomposed using the SWTT framework:
| SWTT Dimension | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill**      | Functional, domain, and technical capabilities required  |
| **Will**       | Behavioral traits, motivation, alignment with org values |
| **Task**       | Core responsibilities, expected deliverables             |
| **Time**       | Timelines, availability, project duration or urgency     |
- Parsed using AI from job context and recruiter input
- Recruiters can edit each section before confirmation
- Output forms the Digital Talent Twin used for screening, interviews, and evaluations

 💡 _This structure becomes the foundational input for AI-powered screening, interview design, and scoring engines._

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use It

1. Go to Recruit Edge → Create New Demand
2. Fill in the role’s basic information (title, skills, urgency)
3. Review the LFI map to select optimal sourcing geographies
4. Analyze DMFI insights to refine salary or skill strategy
5. Review or edit SWTT mapping
6. Save and publish the demand (JD creation console in next feature)

| --------------| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LFI           | Weighted index using talent supply, cost, attrition, and success rates to rank location favorability |
| DMFI          | Weighted index using salary alignment, skill demand, competitor hiring, and role competitiveness     |

_Weights are dynamically adjusted based on role archetype and organizational priority_

##  📌 Conclusion
The Demand Generation module lays the foundation for every successful hire by transforming raw requisitions into data-driven, market-aligned job demands. 
By combining Location Favorability (LFI), Dynamic Market Fit (DMFI) and SWTT mapping, recruiters gain clear guidance on where to hire, how competitive the role is, and exactly which skills, motivations and timelines matter most. 
With these insights in hand and the demand structured — you are ready to move on to crafting the candidate-facing job description in the Branding & Employer Value Proposition (EVP) module.
