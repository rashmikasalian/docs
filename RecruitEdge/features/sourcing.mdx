| Capability Area                    | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Expand Reach & Visibility**      | Automates job distribution to maximize exposure. Taps into passive talent pools (social, alumni, etc.). Matches candidates earlier in their intent lifecycle using AI signals. |
| **Enhance Candidate Quality**      | Uses lookalike modeling to find prospects similar to top performers. Fuzzy matching + entity resolution build holistic candidate profiles. |
| **Optimize Effort & Budget**       | Multi-armed bandit models determine the best outreach channels per role. Programmatic spend reallocates in real time to top-performing platforms. |
| **Drive Inclusivity**              | NLP bias checks ensure inclusive job descriptions and outreach. Connects with specialized networks for underrepresented groups. |
| **Measure & Improve Continuously** | Funnel intelligence highlights source-to-hire performance. Dashboards track cost-per-applicant, time-to-fill, and conversion rates. |

## 🧩 Core Subsystems
### 1.  Programmatic Job Distribution
- Posts jobs to LinkedIn, Indeed, niche boards (e.g. GitHub, Behance), and social media.
- Tracks CTR, apply rates, and source-level conversions.
- Auto-adjusts spend based on performance via bandit algorithms.

### 2.  AI-Driven Channel Optimization
- Uses machine learning to recommend optimal platforms for each role.
- A/B tests messaging and content formats.
- Learns from application and conversion patterns to adjust targeting.

### 3.  Candidate Data Aggregation
- Pulls from ATS, CRM, referrals, and open web profiles.
- Fuzzy-matching engine resolves duplicates and merges data into “golden profiles”.
- Enrichment layer adds skills, experience, and behavior tags.

### 4.  AI-Powered Resume Acquisition & Filtering
- Zero-Touch Resume Aggregation: Automatically pulls resumes from job boards, internal talent databases, referrals, Kaggle, and vendor submissions into one unified profile system.
- Advanced Domain Parsing: Uses AI to detect role-specific skills and keywords (e.g., AML, Fraud Detection, Kafka). Flags gaps in compliance or compensation alignment.
- Match Scoring Engine: Combines domain fit, cost feasibility, skill adjacency, and "Will" factors into a single match score for every candidate.
- Immediate Readiness Flags: Surfaces ready-to-interview profiles and flags those needing further compliance evaluation.
> *Example:*  
> Candidate A — Match Score: 92% (AML + Spark) | Bengaluru
> Candidate B — Match Score: 78% (missing AML) | Hyderabad

### 5.  Passive Talent Engagement
- Curates talent communities by domain, skillset, or experience level.
- Runs drip campaigns with blog content, success stories, and role previews.
- Monitors engagement signals to identify “warm” candidates.

### 6.  Diversity-Aware Sourcing
- NLP-based audit of JD language to ensure inclusive messaging.
- Suggests alternate channels for underrepresented groups.
- DEI metrics visible at each sourcing funnel stage.

### 7.  Sourcing Funnel Analytics
- Dashboards tracking funnel: source → apply → shortlist → hire.
- Key KPIs: cost-per-apply, cost-per-hire, time-to-fill, referral effectiveness.
- Export-ready insights for recruitment ops & leadership.

## ⚙️ How It Works
#### 1.  Choose Channels & Budget
- Recruiter selects roles and configures sourcing strategy.
- System recommends best-fit sourcing platforms and sets a distribution plan.

#### 2.  Launch & Monitor
- Jobs are programmatically posted; applications flow into the system.
- Bandit model reallocates spend to high-performing channels automatically.

#### 3.  Aggregate Candidate Profiles
All applicants and leads are parsed, matched, and enriched into unified profiles.

#### 4.  Engage Passive Talent
- Recruiter sets up nurture tracks and campaigns.
- Engagement signals (clicks, content views) feed back into the model.

#### 5.  Track & Optimize
- Dashboards highlight top-converting channels and problem areas (e.g. low DEI).
- Recruiters adjust strategy with real-time guidance.
