title: Location Favorability Index (LFI)
---

### üéØ Purpose  
"Provide an AI-driven prioritization for roles based on talent market conditions and organizational 
needs, directing recruiters to focus on locations and roles that offer the most strategic value."

### üó∫Ô∏è Scope
1. **Define** how to weigh multiple location-based data points such as skill availability, local growth trends, cost, gender distribution, etc. against role-specific urgency and business impact.  
2. **Deliver** a composite ‚Äúfavorability score‚Äù for each location-role pair to guide sourcing and recruiting decisions.  
3. **Compare** across Tier 1 (major metros), Tier 2 (emerging hubs), and Tier 3/4 (smaller cities, semi-urban areas) to identify strategic hiring opportunities.  

### üß© Objectives
- **Tiered Market Insights:** Distinguish between Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3/4 cities, each with unique cost structures, 
    talent densities, and growth trends.
- **Optimized Recruitment Strategy:** Align high-priority roles with locations best poised to fill those roles 
    quickly and cost-effectively.
- **Scalability & Adaptability:** Adjust scoring weights as business needs or market conditions evolve.
- **Transparency & Risk Awareness:** Clearly outline how scores are calculated and any potential data or compliance pitfalls.

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Data Inputs  
Below is a table of data categories fueling the Location Intelligence Algorithm
>
| **Data Category**             | **Details**                                                                                         | **Tier Implications**                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Talent Availability**       | Count of professionals in that city with required skills; historical fill times, acceptance rates.  | Tier 1 often has large pools, but also heavier competition. Tier 3/4 might have smaller pools but fewer rival openings. |
| **Experience Split**          | % of candidates with 0‚Äì5 yrs, 5‚Äì10 yrs, 10+ yrs experience relevant to the role.                    | Tier 2 might have mid-level availability; Tier 3/4 might lack senior talent.                                            |
| **Growth Rate (CAGR)**        | Past 1‚Äì3 years growth in local talent pool (e.g., from professional networks).                      | Tier 3/4 cities can have high growth but from a smaller base.                                                           |
| **Attrition Rate**            | Frequency of job movement in the local workforce. High turnover can mean more active job-seekers.   | Tier 1 might have high churn due to intense competition; Tier 2 may be more stable.                                     |
| **Demand (Prior/Projected)**  | Role postings in the last 6‚Äì12 months + near-future expansions or competitor hiring plans.          | Tier 1 often sees large demand spikes, Tier 2/3 might have moderate or nascent demand.                                  |
| **Diversity Metrics**         | % women talent or other DEI targets (engineering, design, leadership roles).                        | High DEI presence in Tier 1 is common; Tier 3/4 may show room for improvement or special incentives.                    |
| **Compensation Benchmarks**   | Median salary, cost-of-living indexes, local overhead (office rentals).                             | Tier 1 is typically most expensive, Tier 3/4 cheapest but may require incentives to attract senior hires.               |
| **Business Urgency**          | Internal rating of how critical each role is to key projects or timelines.                          | Applies equally across all tiers but influences final prioritization.                                                   |
| **Location Business Factors** | Nearby universities, client presence, tax breaks, or government incentives.                         | Tier 2 often has emerging ecosystems, Tier 3/4 might have special incentives.                                           |

### ‚öôÔ∏è High-Level Design
#### 1. **Calculation Flow**

    1.1. **Gather Location-Role Data**  
    Pull city-level metrics (e.g., Bengaluru for Tier 1, Pune for Tier 2, Coimbatore for Tier 3, etc.) and open roles (Data Scientist, Software Engineer, etc.).

    1.2. **Compute Individual Scores**  
    - **Talent Score**: Reflects availability, growth, and demand.  
    - **Cost Score**: Incorporates median base pay, overhead, cost-of-living.  
    - **Diversity Score**: Emphasizes underrepresented talent presence (women, other DEI markers).  
    - **Business Urgency Score**: Weighted measure of how critical each role is (from ‚Äúlow‚Äù to ‚Äúurgent‚Äù).

    1.3. **Combine Weighted Scores**
    - Assign different weights (Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥,Œ¥Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥,Œ¥) based on organizational goals.
    - Produce an aggregated LFI for each (city √ó role) pair

    1.4. **Rank or Categorize**
    - Sort from highest to lowest LFI, or label them as High/Medium/Low favorability.
    - Distinguish by city tier if needed: Tier 1 vs Tier 2 vs Tier 3/4.

#### 2. **Sample Formula**
 **LFI** = Œ±√óTalentScore+Œ≤√óCostScore+Œ≥√óDiversityScore+Œ¥√óUrgencyScore

  2.1. **Recommended Approaches**
       Rule-based weighting: Start with an expert‚Äôs approximate weights (e.g., Talent = 0.4, Cost = 0.2, Diversity = 0.2, Urgency = 0.2).  
       
  2.2. **Potential Model Recommendations**
    - Regression-based weighting: If you have historical data on where you successfully hired quickly and cost-effectively, you can train a model to learn optimal weightings automatically.
    - Rule-based weighting: If you lack enough data for machine learning, start with a domain expert‚Äôs suggested weights (e.g., Œ±=0.4Œ±=0.4, Œ≤=0.2Œ≤=0.2, Œ≥=0.2Œ≥=0.2, Œ¥=0.2Œ¥=0.2) and revise over time.

### üìã Detailed Steps
1. **Ingest & Clean Data**  
 Ensure consistent city labels, unify date ranges (like the past 12 months), remove duplicates.  
2. **Normalize & Transform**  
 For each input metric (e.g., median salary, % female talent), use techniques like min-max scaling or z-score standardization so no single metric overwhelms the rest.
3. **Calculate Sub-Scores**
  - Talent Score: Combine availability, growth rate, inverse of competition.
  - Cost Score: Invert average salary or cost-of-living if ‚Äúlower is better.‚Äù
  - Diversity Score: Map DEI percentage to a 0‚Äì100 or 0‚Äì1 range.
  - Urgency Score: Assign 1.0 for ‚Äúmission-critical,‚Äù 0.5 for ‚Äúmedium,‚Äù etc.
4. **Apply Weighted Combination**  
 Multiply each sub-score by its corresponding weight; sum them for the final LFI.
5. **Categorize or Rank**  
  Sort descending by LFI or group into "High: 0.8‚Äì1.0," "Medium: 0.5‚Äì0.8" and "Low: < 0.5."

### üìä Key Output Components
#### 1. **Choropleth Heatmap (India Map View)**  
 - A dynamic, color-coded map of India highlights favorability scores (LFI) by city or region.  
 - Cities are shaded along a green‚Äìyellow‚Äìred gradient, where:
    üü¢  Green = High LFI (favorable for hiring)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Risks & Mitigation 
>

| **Risk Area**                               | **Risk**                                                                                                  | **Mitigation**                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Quality & Coverage**            | Incomplete or outdated data on smaller Tier 3/4 cities.                                                          | Use multiple sources (government data, local job boards, professional networks) and cross-check reliability.                  |
| **Over-Reliance on Historical Trends** | Rapid market shifts (economic downturns, new competitor arrivals) may render historical data less relevant.      | Incorporate real-time feeds (layoff announcements, competitor expansions) and refresh the LFI regularly.                      |
| **Bias in Diversity Metrics**          | Data availability for female or other underrepresented groups may be lower in some regions, skewing the scoring. | Ensure consistent measurement, and consider qualitative or alternative sources (local DEI organizations) for better coverage. |
| **Unintended Consequences**            | Over-focusing on ‚Äúhigh LFI‚Äù cities might create local wage inflation or neglect strategic Tier 1 expansions.     | Combine LFI with broader corporate objectives (like brand presence in key metros, building future pipelines, etc.).           |
| **Privacy & Compliance**               | For certain data sources (social media, location tracking), there may be privacy regulations.                    | Use only aggregated or anonymized data; ensure compliance with local labor and data protection laws.                          |

 ### üìå Conclusion  
The Location Favorability Index (LFI) offers a structured, weighted approach for comparing Tier 1, Tier 2, 
Tier 3/4 cities with respect to talent availability, cost factors, diversity targets, and business urgency. The 
example shows how a smaller, lower-tier city could outperform a major metro if growth and DEI metrics are 
strong. By customizing weightings, organizations can realign the LFI to their evolving strategic priorities 
whether cost savings, fast hiring, or building a diverse talent pipeline.  
Ultimately, LFI ensures that recruiting teams spend their time and budgets where they can achieve the 
greatest impactwith minimal risk, providing a data-driven foundation for location-based hiring 
strategies.
