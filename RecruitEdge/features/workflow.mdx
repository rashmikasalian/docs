title: Detailed Workflow Steps
---

Describes the specific system actions taken to generate, personalize, and evaluate JDs.

### **Step 1: Ingest & Organize Data**
 - Consolidate brand elements, leadership statements, culture docs into a centralized repository.
 - Collect and label historical JDs with performance metrics (clicks, applies).
### **Step 2: Fine-Tune the LLM**
 - Provide exemplar JDs that performed well.
 - Embed brand tone rules (e.g., “We are mission-driven and empathetic”).
 - Tag each JD for role type, skill set, and candidate seniority.
### **Step 3: Candidate Persona Matching**
 - Based on the role and target persona, the system picks relevant brand or leadership statements   
 (e.g., “Culture of Innovation” for tech roles).
 - For a junior role, highlight training programs; for senior roles, highlight leadership opportunities.
### **Step 4: Inclusive Language & DEI Filter**
 - Run a specialized NLP module that detects gendered or exclusionary phrases.
 - Compare each phrase against an internal DEI dictionary or external inclusive language guidelines.
 - Replace or suggest more neutral, inclusive terms.
### **Step 5: Sentiment Feedback Loop**
 - Track immediate engagement (clicks, bounce rate, completion rate for applications).
 - Gather external feedback: social media commentary about the job ad.
 - Adjust the LLM’s prompt or brand messaging to address negative sentiment or boost positives.
### **Step 6:  Output & A/B Testing**
 - Generate multiple JD versions.
 - A/B test them to find which combination of leadership quotes, cultural messages, or DEI highlights leads to the highest conversions.

The detailed workflow offers a step-by-step execution path for transforming static job descriptions into adaptive, brand-aligned, and inclusive content. From structured data ingestion to LLM fine-tuning and DEI optimization, each phase contributes to crafting highly personalized and high-performing JDs.  
The integration of sentiment analysis and A/B testing ensures continuous improvement, empowering recruiters with content that resonates across personas, platforms, and market dynamics.
