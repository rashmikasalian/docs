## 🎯 Purpose

It also enables continuous improvement by tracking real-time engagement, sentiment, and inclusivity feedback.

## 🗺️ Scope

It blends:
- Brand Identity Inputs: Visual assets, tone of voice, corporate values, DEI guidelines.

- Culture Data: Real team stories, event highlights, internal survey sentiment.
- Performance Metrics: CTR, apply rates, DEI compliance score, social media engagement.

## ⚙️ How It Works
#### **Step 1: Recruiter Inputs**
- Role title, seniority level, core responsibilities.
- _Optional:_ Team culture inputs, leadership profiles, value propositions.

#### **Step 2: AI-Powered JD Creation**
- LLM generates JD using role + EVP library.
- Injects pre-approved leader quotes, diversity statements, and culture markers.
- DEI Filter flags exclusionary language

#### **Step 3: Persona Matching & Variant Creation**
- JD variants created per persona (junior/senior).
- Content blocks adjusted: e.g., career progression for juniors vs. autonomy for seniors.

#### **Step 4: A/B Testing and Feedback Loop**
- JDs are published and tracked.
- CTR, apply rate, social sentiment, and DEI score are monitored.
- Underperforming variants are revised automatically or manually.
