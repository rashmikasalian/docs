title: High Level System Design
---
Explains the flow of data and algorithms from brand asset ingestion to JD generation and feedback loops.
- Data acquisition & tagging
- LLM-based JD generation
- DEI filtering
- Persona-matched content recommendations
- Sentiment and DEI tracking
- Real-time optimization engine

### Calculation Flow
##### **1. Data Acquisition**
- Pull brand guidelines, leadership quotes, cultural elements from internal repositories.
- Fetch historical JD data and performance metrics.
- Gather sentiment updates from social media or review sites

##### **2. NLP & Content Generation**
- JD Generator (LLM-based): Fine-tune on curated data to produce new postings or revise existing ones.
- DEI Filter: Use inclusive language checkers to flag potentially biased terms, substitute with recommended phrasing.

##### **3. Content-Based Recommendation**
- Match role/discipline with relevant culture statements or leadership quotes.
- Insert or remove content blocks based on candidate persona insights (early career, experienced professional, etc.).

##### **4. Sentiment & DEI Tracking**
- Monitor external brand sentiment tied to new JDs or brand campaigns.
- Adjust brand messaging strategies if negative or low engagement is detected, especially around DEI topics.

##### **5. Real-Time Optimizer**
- Continuously refine JDs if real-time feedback indicates low click-through or sentiment dips.
- Integrate an auto-update feature that modifies wording to better align with inclusive standards.

## Sample Formula (Conceptual)
Below is a simplified conceptual approach rather than a strict mathematical formula:  
- **JD Content**=LLM(Role Requirements+Brand Tone+Leadership Quotes+Culture Snippets)
- A separate scoring mechanism tracks  
  **EVP Score** = α×JDPerformance+β×SentimentRating+γ×DEICompliance
- **JDPerformance** can be measured by apply rate, clicks, or conversion.
- **SentimentRating** might come from social listening or Glassdoor rating changes.
- **DEI Compliance** reflects alignment with inclusive language guidelines.

This high-level design illustrates a robust, end-to-end system where brand-driven content, inclusive language, and persona alignment converge to generate intelligent job descriptions. From data ingestion to real-time optimization, every step ensures the JD is not only algorithmically precise but also human-centric and responsive. The integrated scoring system further enables continuous improvement, making the content adaptive to both market feedback and internal brand standards.
