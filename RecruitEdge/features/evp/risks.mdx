| **Risk**                        | **Description**                                                                                               | **Mitigation**                                                                                     |

| **Over-Fitting Brand Tone**     | The LLM might produce overly repetitive or shallow statements if brand guidelines are too narrow.             | Periodically refresh training data with new or varied brand content.                               |
| **DEI Data Gaps**               | Lack of comprehensive or updated inclusive language dictionaries for new roles or regional usage.             | Partner with DEI experts; maintain a living dictionary that evolves with feedback.                 |
| **Sentiment Misinterpretation** | Social mentions can be sarcastic or context-specific, leading to flawed positivity/negativity classification. | Use robust sentiment analysis models, incorporate manual checks for borderline cases.              |
| **Brand & Legal Compliance**    | Overuse of leadership quotes might conflict with PR guidelines, or certain claims might be unverified.        | Implement a legal/PR review pipeline for new statements or disclaimers for brand statements.       |
| **Biased LLM Outputs**          | Large Language Models can inadvertently embed biases from training data.                                      | Carefully curate training sets and apply bias-detection methods to the generated text.             |
