title: Implementation Approach
---
Start with a basic LLM, simple tracking, and rule-based language checks. Scale to real-time JD generation, ATS integration, sentiment analysis, and adaptive DEI optimization.

## MVP Phase (Using a Basic Data Layer)
 #### 1.  LLM Setup:
 - Start with an out-of-the-box large language model (e.g., GPT-based) with minimal fine-tuning.
 - Store brand guidelines in a simple text or JSON file.
 #### 2.  JD Performance Tracking:
 - Basic spreadsheets or a simple DB to track each JDâ€™s performance metrics.
 - Weekly or monthly updates, minimal real-time feedback loops.
 #### 3.  Inclusive Language Checker:
 - Implement a rule-based approach (dictionary of flagged words).
 - Provide immediate suggestions for recruiters in a simple interface.

## Final Product (Scalable Pipeline)
 #### 1.  Advanced Fine-Tuning:
 - Continuously retrain or fine-tune the LLM with new JD data, adjusting for evolving brand voice or DEI guidelines.
 #### 2.  Auto-suggest & Real-time Updates:
 - Integrate with an ATS or dedicated recruitment platform for seamless JD generation.
 - Real-time sentiment scanning (social listening, brand mentions).
 #### 3.  Dashboard Integration:
 - Full integration with BI platforms (Tableau, Power BI) to show A/B test outcomes and brand sentiment correlation.
 #### 4.  Continuous DEI Optimization:
 - Expand the rule-based approach to an NLP model that dynamically learns from candidate feedback, ensuring brand content remains inclusive over time.

This phased approach enables organizations to start small and deliver immediate value while setting the stage for long-term scalability. The MVP phase focuses on core functionality with minimal setup leveraging basic LLMs, simple performance tracking, and rule-based inclusive language checks. As needs evolve, the system scales into a robust, intelligent pipeline with real-time JD generation, ATS integration, sentiment analysis, and adaptive DEI capabilities. This ensures continuous improvement, stronger alignment with brand values, and a more inclusive, data-driven recruitment process.
