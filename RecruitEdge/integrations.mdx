The Mantrika N Engine operates on the principle that AI is only as powerful as the data that fuels it. 
Consequently, the algorithms within N are designed and tuned based on a broad range of data inputs—each 
bringing unique nuances and value. This section provides an expanded view of the data sources and formats 
that can be harnessed, highlighting their relevance to various stages of the 3A Framework (Attract, Acquire, Assimilate) 
and the N Engine’s intelligence layers.
